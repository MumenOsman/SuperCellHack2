# Story & World

Inspired by Alice in Wonderland, the world is playful, oversized, and slightly whimsical.

The rabbit is always "almost on time" — not late, not rushed.
The Pocket Watch acts as a gentle guide, reflecting on movement, curiosity, and small achievements.

There is no dark ending or failure — the story exists in moments.
